## Coding Guidelines

-   **Purpose**: Remember that this project is *intentionally* inaccessible in many places. When adding new "bad" examples, please document clearly what the violation is in the corresponding PHP file comments or visible text.
-   **Style**: Keep the PHP and HTML simple. We use Bootstrap 5 for layout.
