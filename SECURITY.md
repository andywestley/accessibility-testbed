# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As this is a testbed for accessibility violations, we do not maintain strict versioning for security support. However, valid security issues in the infrastructure (not the intentional vulnerabilities) should be reported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project (e.g., XSS that is *not* part of a demonstration), please do NOT report it publicly.

Please email andy@andrewwestley.co.uk with:
* Description of the vulnerability.
* Steps to reproduce.

We will review the issue and get back to you.
