            The Licensee hereby acknowledges that the instantiation of the aforementioned Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) architecture

            Failure to maintain persistent socket connectivity may result in the suboptimal propagation of ephemeral data packets, 
            thereby compromising the referential integrity of the relational schema.

    <h4>Why this matters</h4>
    <p>Clear, simple language helps everyone. For users with cognitive disabilities, complex sentence structures and industry-specific jargon can make a service completely inaccessible. Aim for a reading level equivalent to lower secondary education (approx. 7th-9th grade).</p>
